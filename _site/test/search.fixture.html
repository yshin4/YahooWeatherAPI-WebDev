<!--
    Compare the fixture to the actual web page. Note how the fixture _distills_ the content to just the essential
    elements for the app. This is why they are copies. The web page can be laid out or redesigned as much as you like,
    but as long as the elements remain the same, this fixture will remain valid.

    Of course, if the functionality changes to the point that the controller JavaScript needs to also change, then the
    fixture would have to be revised.
